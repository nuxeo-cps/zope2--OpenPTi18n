Changed made by Julien in i18n_xgettext.py for convenience :

   * Removing the lines in the potfile_header that were useless and preventing 	
     to get a correct pot file without processing to remove them.

   * Changing the global declaration of potfile_header tp avoid the warnings

   * I removed as well the possiblity to generate empty msgid's that were
     producing incorrect pot files thus unprocessable ones.
